    <h1 align="center">About The Bookshelf</h1>
</header>

The Bookshelf is a website created by and for students. It allows us to buy and sell books without incurring the fees of
other such marketplaces. As a not-for-profit website, The Bookshelf hopes to facilitate access to lower cost textbooks
and put more money back in the pockets of students, for the the benefit and edification of all.
<p>

<h2>Who Runs The Bookshelf?</h2>

The Bookshelf was founded and edited by Henry Gonzales, Amy Guttman, Rayan Hyder, Jonathan Kan, Ted Kim, and Harshil
Kotamreddy. They are a students at
<a href="https://www.calstatela.edu/">California State University, Los Angeles</a>. They are responsible for the
content of the site. <a href="https://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/prof-jiang-guo">Professor Jiang Guo</a> provided the
backbone for this project - many thanks to you for your patience and support!

</p>
<h2>Where It Started</h2>

The Bookshelf originally was founded in September 2020 by the current
editors, while they were students of CS3337 at
<a href="https://www.calstatela.edu/">California State University of Los Angeles</a>.

<h2>What Gets Listed</h2>
<p>
    Most of the books included in our collection come directly from you and readers like you. These are
    books on your bookshelves, from your courses, from your friends and family. Anyone who registers with us can list
    their books on our site, provided they follow the site rules and <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">
    general internet etiquette</a>.

<h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

We log accesses to this site with the standard data provided in
World Wide Web requests
(which includes, among other things, URLs accessed, time of access, the
IP address of the site making the request, the browsing program and
machine type (if your
browser gives out this information), and the previous URL visited (if your
browser gives out this information.) The identity of the user
is not recorded.
<p>
    We may tabulate aggregate user statistics from our logs to better
    understand usage of our site, and report on its usage to third parties
    (but only in ways that do not allow specific users to be identified).
    We may also, in the future, if a user so requests, use that
    individual's access data to provide customized views of the site, but
    we do not do so now.
</p>
<p>
    We do <b>not</b> give out information about specific accesses or users
    to third parties,
    unless required by law to do so.
    (To date, we never have been so required, to the best of the editor's
    knowledge.)
    The editors believe that access data collected at this site would be
    legally protected by the same patron protections as other library access
    data, but hasn't checked with a lawyer, or with the Libraries, about this.
    In any case, we intend to raise
    any appropriate legal challenges to any attempt to subpoena individual access
    information. (Readers should be aware that the "USA Patriot Act"
    may limit our ability to resist such requests, or inform people that such
    requests have been made. For more about the
    Patriot Act and libraries, see the
    <a href="http://www.ala.org/advocacy/advleg/federallegislation/theusapatriotact">American Library Association's
        information on this subject</a>.)
</p>
<p>
    Cookies are not required to access this site. The editors make their best
    effort to tell people when cookies are required to access books hosted
    elsewhere that are listed by
    this site (so that users can keep cookies turned off if they wish).
</p>
<p>
    Any outside links have different privacy policies not under our control.
</p>

<h2>Copyrights and Permissions</h2>
<p>
    Links to any point in these pages are welcome, and ordinary links
    do not require permission.
    However, if you want to redistribute or 'mirror' substantial
    portions of these listings or pages, or create derivative works
    or displays based on
    them (beyond what is clearly allowed by fair use or the inherent
    public domain status of facts by themselves), you must abide by
    licenses associated with them, or where no license is given,
    obtain prior written permission. Write to the editor at the
    address below to pursue permissions.
</p>
<p>
    The editors of this page intend to respect any copyrights
    of the authors of the books listed by the site. We will not knowingly
    list a book that is neither online with the copyright holder's
    permission, nor in the public domain (or otherwise legally available)
    in the country where the online book is stored.
    We also attempt to warn people about books that
    are legal to access in a server's hosting country, but may be illegal
    to access from the US (where this site is located).
